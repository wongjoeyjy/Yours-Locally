### Description

YoursLocally is a community for home based businesses to showcase their labors of love and get the attention they deserve - from people who are passionate about supporting local talent.

### Inspiration

Person A has lost her job due to COVID-19 layoffs. She is an avid baker and is seeking to get some income by doing what she loves best: baking. However, she finds it challenging to advertise the delicious cakes that she makes. Going onto cluttered platforms like Facebook and Carousell means she has to fight with a lot of other messaging and products to be heard. She is looking for alternatives where her cakes won’t just be “one of many” products.

Person B is a white collar professional who supports local talents and wares, and likes consuming things that are not too mainstream or commercial, as it is a way for her to express her individuality. She usually discovers home grown brands at local flea markets, but due to COVID-19, there are much lesser of such events. Hence, she is looking for a curated online experience for her to find out more about interesting wares.
