### Description

Yours Locally is a community for home based businesses to showcase their labors of love and get the attention they deserve - from people who are passionate about supporting local talent.

### User Stories

- Person A has lost her job due to COVID-19 layoffs. She is an avid baker and is seeking to get some income by doing what she loves best: baking. However, she finds it challenging to advertise the delicious cakes that she makes. Going onto cluttered platforms like Facebook and Carousell means she has to compete with a plethora of unrelated advertisements and products to be seen. She is looking for alternatives where her cakes won’t just be another “one of many” products.

- Person B is a white collar professional who supports local talents and wares, and likes consuming things that are neither too mainstream nor commercial, as it is a way for him to express his individuality. He usually discovers home grown brands at local flea markets, but due to COVID-19, there has been a sharp decrease in the number of such events. Hence, he is looking for a curated online experience for him to find out more about interesting wares.
